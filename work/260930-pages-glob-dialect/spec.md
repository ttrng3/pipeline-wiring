# Spec — Pages workflow: one glob dialect (approved)

Status: approved by Ty 30/09 via claude-config PRs 12 and 14 (specs: claude-config
`work/260930-pages-glob-dialect/spec.md` and `work/260930-pages-set-slash/spec.md`,
42/42 Linux tests at e914738).

## Change
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` becomes the template at e914738 minus the optional placeholder comment. `.pages-allow` gains a two-line header pointer to these rules. Nothing else changes.

## Behaviour changes
- Only simple sets (`[abc]`, `[!x]`, `[^x]`; no set inside a set, no `/` inside a set) are allowed in `.pages-allow`; any other `[` or `]` stops the deploy.
- `[^x]` means "not x" in both checks.
- A backslash on any line, or any wildcard on an `@` line, stops the deploy.
- Header comment lists each fail-closed condition, including an allowlist with nothing to publish.

Pre-check 30/09 on this repo's main (comments stripped, grepped for a backslash or any `[`/`]`): 0 lines. So nothing changes on the site today.

## Pass condition (after merge)
First run `mode: live`, deploy green, served files byte-identical to the baseline in the PR body (path, HTTP status, first 12 hex of sha256); a file a routine changes in between is compared with its copy at the deployed commit. A failure reverts this PR.
